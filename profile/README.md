## âœ¨ Project Overview

Our team is interested in helping people with diabetes. By making this product, we hope to help the users to track and reduce their risk of diabetes by giving insights and personalized recommendations on diet and activities, and also identify diabetes if the user desires.

## ðŸš‘ Reasons

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases that could lead to serious health complications such as cardiovascular disease, nerve damage, kidney failure, and blindness.
